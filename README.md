### Introduction
For generations, education has been both a promise and a pressure for South Asian American families—shaping aspirations, identities, and relationships across lines of migration. As these families have built new lives in the U.S., their stories reveal not only hopes for the future but also the challenges and negotiations that education brings, both for immigrants and their children. Examining the language and emotion in oral histories offers a unique lens into how educational values are inherited, reimagined, and sometimes contested—illuminating the evolving meaning of education across generations of immigrants. Through natural language processing of a rich archive of South Asian American oral history transcripts, I trace how different generations articulate their experiences with education, the emotions woven into their narratives, and the ways these perspectives shift over time.

### Data
The dataset consists of 769 immigration oral history transcripts extracted from 41 collections and subcollections.[^1] Interviewees hail from six continents, and 291 are South Asian Americans (236 Indian, 23 Pakistani, 19 Bangladeshi, 8 Sri Lankan, 3 Nepali, 2 Bhutanese). Responses were split into five-sentence segments, cleaned, and filtered for education-related content using keywords. 

A RoBERTa-based classifier—fine-tuned first on the full corpus for domain adaptation, then on 431 transcripts with known generations for classification—achieved 98% accuracy in classifying oral histories as having first-generation vs second-generation speakers. This translated to 35859 first-generation documents, 8437 (23.53\%) of which were about education, and 9151 second-generation documents, 2072 (22.64\%) of which were about education. The similarity in these percentages suggests that education is a comparably prominent topic for both first- and second-generation South Asian Americans.

### Research Question 1: How do different generations of South Asian Americans talk about education?
KeyBERT and log-likelihood ratio (LLR) analyses were used to identify generation-specific language surrounding education. First-generation South Asian Americans emphasized cultural identity, tradition, and academic achievement, while second-generation speakers focused on family relationships, social belonging, and identity. These findings reveal a generational shift: first-generation narratives frame education as a path to advancement and cultural connection, whereas second-generation narratives highlight education as a space for identity exploration and relationship-building.

### Research Question 2: What emotions toward education are expressed by each group?
To analyze emotion, I fine-tuned RoBERTa-based models on a labeled subset of interview responses to classify documents as one of 28 emotions. Fine-tuning [SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions]{https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions} achieved 70% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 0.45. 

Applying the best-performing model to all education-related segments, I found that sadness was the predominant emotion for both generations, often linked to loss and family transitions. KeyBERT and LLR analyses identified concepts, experiences, and issues most closely associated with this emotional response. First-generation South Asian Americans still emphasized cultural identity but the keywords tended to skew more religious. Second-generation South Asian Americans still emphasized family and social networks, but the focus was on relationships with older family members (e.g. grandparents). This could be further explained by the fact that LLR analysis produced words for both generations relating to death and loss. 

Additionally, differences in emotion distributions between first- and second-generation education narratives were found to be statistically significant (p = 8.79 * 1e-3, Cramér’s V = 0.16). Second-generation narratives displayed a broader and more intense range of emotions—including fear, disgust, love, and realization—suggesting a shift toward more emotionally expressive and nuanced storytelling about education compared to first-generation accounts.

### Research Question 3: What major themes emerge in these discussions, and how do they and the emotions felt towards them differ across generations?
Using BERTopic, I identified and mapped subtopics to 17 themes (e.g., higher education, schooling, family, identity, activism, finances, immigration), and found significant generational differences in theme distribution (p < 0.0001, Cramér’s V = 0.61). For the first generation, higher education was the most prevalent theme, with the themes unique to this generation being immigration, finances, government, and violence—reflecting migration, adaptation, and economic pressures. The second generation focused more on schooling, family, and identity, and its unique themes were identity, activism, responsibility, and social life.

Themes present in both generations, such as community and career, shifted from sadness in the first generation to pride in the second, while schooling was discussed with sadness by the first generation and disgust by the second. Family, higher education, and place were associated with sadness in both groups, pointing to persistent concerns, pressures, or difficulties shared across generations. Sadness is the predominant emotion for the first generation, while the second generation has a more diverse set of associated emotions.

Additionally, the most common subtopic for the first generation discussed education in the context of navigating systems and barriers and had an associated emotion of sadness. LLR analysis highlighted distinctive words such as alienation and father, suggesting that sadness in this context is particularly associated with personal loss and feelings of separation. The second most common subtopic discussed university life and moving to a new place, also associated with sadness. KeyBERT analysis revealed themes of isolation. However, the third most common subtopic focused on music, dance, and art and was associated with pride.

Furthermore, the most prominent subtopic for the second generation centers on family and is linked to sadness. KeyBERT analysis surfaced terms such as “engineer” and “pursue”, reflecting the interplay between family expectations and professional aspirations, and LLR analysis identified distinctive words such as “trip” and “away”, suggesting that the associated sadness is often rooted in separation and the emotional impact of family transitions. The second most common subtopic focuses on college and career, also marked by sadness. Keywords like “grad,” “transferring,” “struggle,” and “grades” point to the pressures of higher education, while LLR terms such as “hard” and “miss” indicate that this sadness stems from academic setbacks and unmet expectations. Finally, the third most common subtopic revolves around K-12 school experiences, where disgust is the dominant emotion. Here, KeyBERT highlights words like “school,” “principal,” “microaggressions,” and “angry,” while LLR surfaces terms such as “newspaper,” “talked,” “working,” and “experience,” suggesting that negative institutional experiences and how they are discussed within peer groups and the broader community are especially salient.

### Conclusions
My research provides the first large-scale computational analysis of how first- and second-generation South Asian Americans talk and feel about education, uncovering clear generational differences in both content and emotional tone. While education is central for both groups, first-generation narratives focus on migration, adaptation, and overcoming barriers—often marked by sadness and pride—whereas second-generation accounts center on identity, family, activism, and social life, displaying a broader range of emotions and reflecting more complex negotiations of belonging and cultural identity.

However, this research has a few limitations: the oral history corpus overrepresents Indian Americans, potentially limiting generalizability; computational methods, while powerful, abstract away narrative nuance; and emotion classification is constrained by the size and diversity of annotated data; and topic-to-theme mapping involved subjective judgment. Future work could address these by expanding the dataset for more balanced representation, incorporating more nuanced emotion annotation and mixed-methods or longitudinal approaches, and increasing reliability through multiple annotators or automated clustering. 

Overall, this work demonstrates the power of combining computational and qualitative methods to reveal both the shared and divergent contours of educational experience among South Asian Americans, offering a model for future research on immigrant and intergenerational identity.[^2]
