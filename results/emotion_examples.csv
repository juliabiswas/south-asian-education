admiration,"usually, most people do stay…surprisingly…um it’s actually um…really good the University is like, especially the medical faculty and the medical college of Colombo is really good Both my parents went there and it’s world recognized, like if you went to college there just for undergrad whenever you want to go somewhere else for graduate degree, what is basically what my dad and mom did um, it’s recognized all over the world, it’s a good University…but I’m not doing medicine like my parents… So the engineering school not so much, I mean it’s all free so that’s really good"

admiration,"But we had some remarkably good teachers in Economics particularly Bhabhatosh Datta who was there was another Bhabhatosh Datta who was a literary figure, this is an economist and he was probably the most spectacularly lucid expositor in economics I have ever run into in my life"
admiration,"I remember running in the dark down the long lane I was in Presidency College, I was in English honors, saying to myself, I believe I am an intellectual You know, it was the most incredible thing It was silly, but there it was"
admiration,"It was a fantastic feeling, and I say that it was a very intellectual school because the teachers were converted aboriginals and so-called low castes, and so therefore they were completely, like, inspired with the love of education, and they felt that it was a fantastic thing that they were educating, basically We didn't really understand that then, but as I grew older I realized that they were extremely excited that they were actually educating upper-caste caste Hindu children and Muslim children and so on and so forth It was a very, very wonderful atmosphere"
fear,"My mother was saying that when I was five years old, when I first went to school, and she would have a servant that would take me to school and bring me back And one time he forgot and she was wondering why I'd not come home, and the thing was I did not see the servant and I just walked out of school, five years old, and I was walking in this town ,and then somebody saw me and said, Who are you, what are you doing I was kind of crying and he brought me back home I'm not sure how much that will happen now, but I mean, many kids would get molested or kidnapped or hurt or all those things that you hear about Gupta: And so, it  has become a more risky place for everyone, and more so"
fear,"Like it was really tragic and like kids couldn't go to school So like, you know, you lose years’ worth of life there and like, there's nothing to do, like, I mean these people can't really leave and go anywhere else because they want to be around when the water dissipates and they can like reclaim their house and like otherwise they’re worried that they’re just going to like condemn everything and destroy it all because like that's what like a government would want to do that just be like, let's just call it, cut our losses and then like just like end all this and like cause like records for like land, when the water recedes, like you can't even be sure that like the markings of like property lines and stuff, are going to be conserved So like literally, unless the people were there, they felt like they would just get screwed, so they, a lot of people just stayed and that just meant that they were like living on rafts basically, like they were just like living on rafts and it's like, surrounded by water, but you can't drink any of it, you can't use it for anything, cause it's like just, it's like, you know, brackish, salt water that's like very quickly just sewage, it's just, it doesn't drain anywhere, it doesn't go anywhere, it just stays there, and it took them and it just doesn’t get reabsorbed into the ground, and I think it's like, it was a pretty disastrous like occurrence, the 2004 tsunami and like so rapid, like literally like it was overnight in two hours they went from just a bustling regular old city to like nothing, it's crazy ” Andy: “Yeah, and uh you said that your, you focused on reverse osmosis when you were there ” D"
fear,"Then I went to graduate school, then I realized if you finished your biochemistry, there is a high demand in western countries, like Australia, British, and uh so all the people who ever finished biochemistry, they took what they call post-doctoral fellowship in one of the universities in one of the uh American university or Canadian university, London, all those things Then I said okay, I was in back of my mind, even I was little nervous, how do I leave this country and go somewhere else My English is so poor, I don't what the culture is, I heard all kind of things, pizza and all, I'm little bit worried about that But"
fear,"but by the meantime he was transferred to Bombay he was working for a telephone company, I mean not a telephone company, telephone company owned by the federal government in India, central government, he's working as the accounts officer for the telephone, so he was in Bombay at that time and then finally, eventually, fall into places, they arranged me a fellowship and then I went to London That was my first exposure to Western country, everything was brand new to me I was so scared and so nervous, but fortunately there was one person from Christian Medical College went there and he was living there He came to the airport, tried to settle me down and uh"
fear,"then I worked in a Geist hospital and Welcome Research Laboratory M: And the my colleagues and my professor was really good, really with open arm they welcomed me, they arranged me to settle down everywhere and uh then that was where it started Even though initially I was scared, within a matter of 3 or 4 weeks, except I get used to that, that uh except the food wise, I was suffering, I could not eat there just without salt or without any spices"
fear,"Yea…um yea I don’t remember uh like the beginnings when I was smaller but then when I was like 14 or 15 umm that was towards the end, like you said it became really serious and um I do remember like…like…two of my friends father’s were like head officers in the war so they had first hand experiences too and they would tell us stuff then you would see it in the news and it became a really big deal and um…uh LTTE was the first people to use suicide bombers as a weapon uh and…I t was…and we got a lot of international attention on the end…we were on BBC and stuff, that was big for us  we were huge…uh but…yea…it was strange…it was a big time It was scary, it was scary to go out…in like in public because there were bombs going out in Colombo…and I heard a bomb once we saw the flames, like the smoke coming out from my school, well I could see it and that scared us a lot even though no one died from that bomb thank god"
fear,"Lots of people did die in Colombo uhm…yea…so um…it got to a point where we could not go to school because we were too scared and…winning the war was really important I guess for safety Clarissa; Yea…from the reading I’ve done…from all over the world…from sources in England, from sources in America…and um there’s not a lot or like Sri Lankan government publications…There is some that I found but not a lot…um they all sort of talked about the LTTE um…or also known as the Tamil Tigers which a lot of people around the world refer to them as, as a terrorist organization…so um just um…as an American we and just people all around the world have very specific connotations of a terrorist organization so when you hear that…what exactly does that mean to you : Um…well…um I don’t think Prabakharan who is the leader had any terrorist ideals…like really…I don’t think he wanted to terrorize the country he just wanted part of the country…so, but I think he realized that it was impossible to get that without brute force Um…and they did mention, like they did proclaim themselves as a terrorist organization and that’s what scared lots of people around the world…um…I don’t know it was just strange because that terrorist organization grew up from our own country It’s not somebody who invaded us or something"
fear,"oh, oh okay) : Ummm… Ummm…well I’m Buddhist also and that’s like the most significant, most abundant religion I should say yea um so… in our religion and in…in our religion there isn’t anything forbidding um homosexual relationship and neither is there anything in our culture it’s just that there’s this law in Sri Lanka that says it’s forbidden, there’s nothing in our culture which says it’s bad so…I think people are so scared of it and they use the law against it, they don’t ever say like the religion is saying anything or that you’re going against your culture…they just use the law umm…and umm…and so nobodies out, nobody, I guess maybe like underground people are out but then…I don’t know how they’re doing that , but um, it’s really scary to be out, especially in college, in school…but um I know some lesbians I our school uh who aren’t out but they still have relationships with like other girls and in school it’s just like my sister comes and tells me about them kissing in the bathroom and somebody saw and it’s like a huge deal…teachers come and they scold and it’s just  ("
fear,"Um, so—and I was, you know, uh trying to do the paperwork for a divorce and stuff like that, but this was again a huge challenge Because here wewere, after being together since high school, raising a family, and just one night, he disappeared right after we moved to Baltimore We were living um in Highlandtown in this little rowhouse in a new city and all of sudden overnight, literally overnight,  I became a single mom So, um it was very traumatic I remember the next day, because I didn’t know what was happening, I went to your school and told them that something’s happening, I don’t really know what, but that I was scared that  he would come back and try to take you or do something"
fear,"I was too afraid to even go to the—stay in the house So, we packed a bag and we stayed at my cousin’s house in Arbutus for like three weeks And I told the school not to let anybody else pick you up except me or Michael, who I worked for, who also lived in that—close to the school Because I was scared that this guy could come back and do anything just the way he left So, we did that, and after that, um we did stay in the house, but I was just totally alone um"
pride,"And I got, I got this job, I can remember I got this job for like, you know, big company that there was like electrical machines, like motors and fans and turbines and stuff like that, rotating machinery, uh called Crompton Greaves, and, um, and so uh my parents were pretty happy about that and they were like, okay, so you have a life now are you're going to build life on this company, and there they were pretty okay with that situation, and my first postings, it's like a nationwide company and it like it’s similar to GE, they're, they're almost equivalent like GE here So it's like the Indian GE, and so they sent me to a small pump, like they make like a turbine pumps at a turbine pump unit in Goa which I don't know if you’ve heard of Goa, Goa is a state in India, it's a very small state like Vermont, um, it's uh, it's famous because it's like, it's on the beach, it's basically just one big beach, like the party state, it's uh where if you live anywhere in sort of central in, in India, not very far north or whatever, if you want to like go have a crazy time, it's like our Vegas, it’s our, like our, like Orlando and it's like its beaches spring break equivalent, like the beer is cheap and like they plenty of beaches and um, you just like if you're in college, if you're young guy, or young people, that's where you go, so I was like kind of thrilled about like living in Goa, I'd never actually been to Goa really, and so, so we went and visited this factory, it was kind of like, you know, factories are not impressive really Like they're like, it's a lot of like, you know, I, I toured it, so where I'd be working, it's kind of like sketchy looking and like, I was like, shit man, this is like, this is legit, this is happening, I’m going to be living in this state, It's beautiful, beautiful beaches, and a great place to live But like, I guess this is how life starts and it was going to, this is going to be the future And I feel like that in many phases in my life, I'd be like, shit, like this, this is, this is all it's going to be, and then, um, and so like the day before I like, like the week before my start date, I was like, ah, you know what"
pride,"’, like it's the most, you know, I’d love to do it, and then he's like, well minor caveat, like you will have to like go through basic training and uh, do all the qualification stuff and then they will fast track you through like officer academy and stuff and then you'll be good, I was like, I guess I'm doing that, and then he's like, also it's like great, it's a great, great career choice, you know, because then we'll just sign you up like through Grad school You can basically work on this as your graduate studies and you can do an Institute of Science as a graduate student and you can just, you know, it'll all be good, like I think it's all, it's a smart thing to do, and I was like, this is my, I think this is exactly what I wanted, it was exactly what I wanted So then I did like navy stuff, and data, the training was like super easy, like I don't think, I feel like I was the most challenging thing I ever did, uh, you know, it's all the same like militaries around the world, it's like exactly the same, it's just different flags Principals are identical and you just pretty much just, you know, they tell you who did not like and who you like and then you're like, all right, cool, that's, that's, that's, that's fine, and then, I did that then unfortunately, then as soon as I finished and as soon as I got my stripes and stuff and I signed my commission, they, we were ready for sea trials And so straight away went onboard, so grad school as such was not like I didn't have time to like come back to Bangalore and Bangalore is in the middle of the country, so it's like landlocked, and so we had to go to a, like a naval base and that's where we operated from, and then, uh, so I was on base doing like, you know, pre pretrial testing and super busy, every day was like awesome"
pride,"So, I talked to people and all the stuff, and I discovered, you know, that I could do a good service by planning good communities and job places and uh hospitals and all those things, you know, that really could provide a good service And, uh, and then I won’t see blood or I won’t see the math So, what I did was that I did my graduate work at Peabody-Vanderbilt, and then I look for where should I go to—go to get the degree"
pride,"And from there, uh I went to classes, and in 1966, I graduated with a master’s degree"
pride,"In three hours, you need to excel which I found it extremely difficult, especially in social studies and English memorizing whole year study in a small question but somehow I found the science and mathematics I can do really excel well, even though one year study then, that's that was it started, I was leaning towards science and maths, nothing else"
pride,"I said okay that's fine, but I don't have a car or anything No don't worry about it, it is not far away from the train station, so you can live there, Then I moved to their house and I got little bit foredom, freedom Then I started exploring the story to cut the story short, that is where I am first learning my cooking and my before that, I didn't even know how to make coffee M: I learned cooking, and though I explored London, it developed a lot of confidence in me M: Not only that, I was managed to successfully complete the research project, everybody was so happy there"
pride,"And I had a independent, very independent hand to run a project I can hire students and I can hire lab technicians, I can do whatever I want, only restriction, it has to be within the mucus immunology area M: Then I jumped on to it, I didn't even think about second chance That is the best place to raise family I think Then at that time I kind of changed my mind, let me live in Philly area and I can visit India, help them out kind of thing, because I got my green card and I got my decent job and I got my child here"
pride,"I think I almost rediscovered myself, um, living through my children Um, you know, having all the wonderful experiences of sending them to school here to get that experience of of, uh, volunteering, of being with them on their field trips, of of- the way the educational system was, in this country, was so different than what we grew up with And sometimes, I feel that, as an immigrant, we do tend to confuse our children, because they learn one thing in school and then they come home and we try to enforce certain ways that we grew up with at home and, um, I am I am extremely proud to say that, um, that my children actually handled that really well That that they, um, you know, in spite of, in spite of being told, you know, things like- okay, either it was their food habits or their studying habits or whatever it was, they adapted so well to it But, but I think I changed my whole opinion of how education and- needed to be so well balanced, um, and it just didn’t have to be study, study, study the way the way we were kind of brought up, um, in in India, you know"
pride,"And I was like, “Yeah ” And I started this conversation with her Here’s me trying to start a basketball team in a girls’ school where I had no friends Malindi: So So, um but she was—really encouraged me"
pride,"Yeah, I couldn’t, walk really well Um I was kind of slow, but I went back to school, and I remember that the first day of school um everybody had brought me presents, and the teachers and everybody were so welcoming, and it was a really cool day Um and then, eventually when I got physically better, I joined the basketball team again and you actually came to a game Malindi: My mom brought you to a basketball game Um so, I graduated from American International School of Johannesburg the year later after that"
disgust,"Like 14-hour days I lived on board pretty much nonstop Um, and so, uh, we had a super fun time and then, but like year one went by, we had lots of trials and stuff, but I had really not done much like coursework for Grad school And then year two was coming around and like we had some minor wrinkles, let's say in one of our sea trials we went out to sea, um, uh, and we hit a really bad storm And then as you can imagine, like it was like a bunch of different, it was like a mess in a sense that like our satellite warning system had not had, had not warned us because we had uh, like, uh, we had acquired a rat problem because we had gone and if… there was a major tsunami in that area, like Indonesia, Sri Lanka and other countries were completely submerged”"
disgust,"So then thankfully, like in the way the contract was written and stuff, I was able to get out of my short service like commission, um, and then at that point, like I only had two choices, one was like stay in the Navy and just be a random Navy officer or doing whatever random, like a technical assignment they would give me or I would have to go back to this project and spend another three years rebuilding this vessel, uh, for future, like for an unknown future And because they were in an aggressive timeline to rebuild a lot of pressure to work on this, and I don't think I would have had time to do any grad school stuff, and like I was way behind already, so the cleanest, nicest way to get out as recommended by some people at where I used to work with were, like, you know, ‘just start applying for grad school elsewhere where you get out, it's clean ah, and so I was eager to go to Sweden, mainly I want to go to Chalmers, uh, and then I applied to a couple of schools in Sweden, um, and then, uh, it was very rushed and I didn't really prep very hard and I got like, I thought it was a pretty bad ass, I had a good resume and stuff, and so when I applied and I got rejected, I was like, ‘Shit, like I need, I think I really, I screwed up my career here’, like, so, so then I, um, then I sort of took a couple of months, uh, re-, you know, planned out like my resume and like application letters and everything, and this time I just like, the safe option was to apply to the U S because like the U S"
disgust,"Qualified for I am not getting it so I have to go to another field, start from the scratch, it takes lot of time and effort to come back and start a new job but situation is there, that’s what uh–– No, she was basically an accountant, master’s degree––master’s in accounts but she also, the same way I’ve been treated, like wherever she goes, “Oh you have a beautiful like education,” “You are qualified,” but when it comes to the final thing, they say, “We are sorry,” because it’s all about––it’s kind of a discrimination because they don’t give a job since she has not done her education here And finally, she ending up getting a job as a bank teller being an accountant so that’s really unfair, but what to do, we have to survive, we have to get a job so she was working there for almost four years"
disgust,"My sister’s  brother, my Mama ji, he was there too, and they gave him piece of paper, “This is the case, this the name of the people, let’s give this to judge and they’ll be fine ” And I took the bicycle, I went part of the way and discovered I didn’t bring the piece of paper, so what am I going to do When I came in secretly to pick up the piece of paper, um I overheard the conversation going on between my mother, her brother, and my father He said, “Now—” remember, I’m the oldest in the family of five, and they said, “You know, he’s grown up, we— and he finished his college, we’ll get him a good job and get him married ” And I said, “Oh my god, I don’t want to get married"
disgust,"Once I got the admission, immigration used to be fairly simple, you know So, when I got the admission, I got the—even the card room assigned in the dorm, all that stuff ready to go I was going to be going to the engineering school And what happened when I went to the—I told my father, okay, once I made up my mind, I don’t want to stick around there And in my heart it was, “I don’t want to get married, I want to go, and you know, why not"
disgust,"And it’s only side I worked at gas station, you know, whatever it is to that, you know, stuff And finally, I went to couple of places to get a better field My parents wanted me to be either a doctor or engineer But, uh my math was not that good, so I didn’t want to be an engineer Doctor, I didn’t want to be a doctor because in high school in India, I took the uh, you know, b— biology and botany, and the teacher, first they said, “You know, we are going to cut a rabbit and all that stuff"
disgust,"The city, at that time I say, “I hate the city, I don’t ever want to move there ” But then I went to school here, Catholic University and all that And we loved it Ever since, loved this place so much"
disgust,"Not like I want to be a United States president, small baby steps, small goals Okay in three months, I want to finish this whatever education, okay I finished it Let me go and gain some experience in sixth months Go and find some opportunity to get the next one Oh, I don’t like this"
disgust,"Um… well… when I was like 14, 15ish, yea uh I went for this Math Olympiad and that made me me really interested in math, I wanted to be a math major, uh but Sri Lanka doesn’t have a good math program anywhere in the country so um… so umm uh my cousin and my aunt lives here ummm, she told me to come and check this out and I checked University of Maryland and they have a really good math program which is why I decide to come to Maryland and then I decided I had to come to US---"
disgust,"Well um we learn this extensively for our history lessons…in our history lessons since we’re so small…and we’re like at least in Buddhism like we learn Buddhism also in school…in those likes we learn to like hate the British era because it changed us, it deprived us of lots of values kind of…um like there were lots of fighters who wanted them out and who were fighting against them…and there are heroes, our heroes just like Martin Luther King… those kinds of heroes…those are ours like the ones who fought against the British…SO um we’re taught to hate them in general  like at least the era, but then for history we learn the good sides And there are lots of good sides…I don’t like…I don’t…I wish we weren’t captured but I’m glad we learned We had English because of them, we had lots of good stuff because of them"
gratitude,"Because, you know, life raft, you don't know where you're going, you're just sort of stuck, and then, and then, uh, thankfully, uh, about two days later, they, uh, they were, they started a search and rescue effort and then a search and rescue aircraft, Garnier spotted us, uh, like, and then they, they spotted us, they marked our location, and then I think a day later they had redirected like a survey vessel to like, come pick us up, and so then we got picked up and then brought back to shore and of course like after debrief and stuff They gave me a long shore leave, uh, to like take some time and figure out what next And like it's all very complicated because like, I was still officially, like we were, I was in the Navy, so like I, I couldn't escape Like there's nothing that I could do, uh, this, this project has pretty much had this huge roadblock right, like we lost the vessel, so like it was like a lot of reviews happening and stuff, and then, um, so, so, the, the guy who was a sort of in charge of this project was like, we just have to go back to rebuild phase, like, I mean we lost the prototype but we need to build a second prototype, that's just the way we have to do it and you know it's going to cost much less to build a second prototype, so let's just do it, and then so he was all gung ho about it and the Navy was like, oh you know you guys are going to take us another three years to build this like and it's going to be wherever we need to like reevaluate like priorities and stuff, meanwhile you don't get like assigned to this project now because like they're going back to shore to designing you, your, your next tour of duty, you're sort of figuring out what your next assignment is going to be, it’s not going to be this, I was like, so what about grad school and stuff like, you know the whole part of this was so I could like build a career They were like, ‘well that sucks for you but like this is what's going to happen’"
gratitude,"As a matter of fact, you know, uh wherever I went, being different, the American students as well as the faculty, they wanted to get close enough to find out more about you And work with you And toward the end hours every time the conversation, “Anything we could do, we’ll be there for you ” And that’s what gave me the strength to continue"
gratitude,"What he thought he made a mistake not a mistake, but he gave his family very protected life, provided everything They have a servant, they have a government vehicle to go around so my wife doesn't know what ischallenge, and what is difficult Food is there, transport is there, happily going to college and come back"
gratitude,"yeah, So, although Sri Lanka is a- a majority Buddhist country I attended a Catholic school And, uh, I grew up around uh, quite a lot of Buddhists and Muslims And, I was blessed to be immersed in such diversity"
gratitude,"I- and um, I really appreciated um, uh, going to school in a Catholic setting, and starting school with prayer And um, scripture study and mass in the morning It- it has helped me stay true to the gospel even 'til this day"
gratitude,"And my- my mom wanted me to grow up in that- in that circle where God was given a place, uh, it's God was given the foremost place uh, in education And where uh, we had good examples to look up to- we uh, um- all of our principals were priests And- I, even though there are uh, debatable examples  of priests  today- I- I grew up with very good examples, and they- they- to this day um, I even quote some of the- the um, the sermons that they delivered growing up And um, they definitely um, um, they definitely mentored me and put me in the spiritual path"

joy,"It’s a follow up question And in general, I am very happy Happiness is when you see your own people When, you don’t know, especially your mom, she will get so excited to see American-Indian people When I was living in Vermont, or in Salt Lake City, I remember in Vermont we had a professor his name is and we were very happy"

love,"Sometimes we just sat in the other lawn in front of in the college nobody stopped us from doing that you know, so we always discussed I learned a great deal about modern literature, modern poetry from them-and I had my first love affair happened there and that young man, my class mate he had he used to give me new books of volumes of poetry"

love,"And I think I participated in multiple organizations including the student government and activities board, and I think, like I said, just having that circle was really helpful and was a really good protective factor for me It was a really beautiful campus as well And I love being at ULM I lived on campus for about 2 1/2 years and I don't think being on campus made a difference I don't think I was able to make friends with my roommates because of their priorities, they worked home every weekend, so I didn't get to spend a lot of time with them"
love,"I don’t think feeling weight or burden is quite what I felt I think, first and foremost, I feel and felt blessed just to have the chance for my work to be a labor of love You know, I wrote my senior thesis in college about sort of the relations between the U S and Asian, I’ve always been interested in sort of the connections between the West and the East"
love,"And that's where I felt like, I knew four languages, but I don't know any of them at literary level So, I spent about three years learning my vocabulary, so it would become to the United States graduate-level, on my own And then, I started reading a lot of literature, which I have a complete love for reading So, I read lot of American literature And everything makes you grow and change"
love,"No, very loving father He emphasized that we all get a good education Because we were seven brothers and sisters, total My eldest one, when he graduated from high school from the village, he was sent to Dehradun for further education When I finished my high school, because there was no intermediate in the village, I went to Roorkee, which was nearby town"
love,"In the meantime, when I was doing my PhD, he also did his PhD in India, with the same professor who had arranged our marriage So, of course he wanted to come, so of course I had no choice, I had to come with him And I was not unhappy about that, but after that, whatever he did more or less decided my fate I could not go somewhere else And here, after he got his job, somebody else gave me a job in Urbana, and then I started working as a post-doc with another professor, who also liked me very much, and I liked him and we did good research"
disappointment,"Then my father, ""You don't know what you are studying, you don't know what kind of job you are getting, so what are you studying for "" Somehow I was very adamant: ""Let me study for two years and let me find out what it is"" Then I kind of convinced him, ""Oh I work in the hospital, in the laboratory, analyzing the samples, estimating cholesterol, glucose, and all kind of thing Oh he said ""Oh, looks like something interesting, then I went for uh a biochemistry, a masters in biochemistry M: But, at that time there was not much job opportunity for biochemist, a whole hospital need one analyst, they don't a masters in biochemistry, they can hire some HLC, I mean some high school kid, and train them to do it, so I'm kind of stuck there, except I got some teaching job in a local college, I started doing some teaching But I thought that life is not just teaching, there must be more than that"
disappointment,"‘Oh my god next January 30 my VISA is expiring, what should I do ’ That is one thing that was the hardest part Somehow we managed to, I worked through that And the other hardest part I can think is, even though I have the knowledge and experience and education, I could not compete as good as a fellow American Because their communication, their society is much much better than me, in general"
disappointment,"It was—it was an awesome school Very big, it went through kindergarten through high school, it’s a really great school Um so after many months I was going to school there And it was in English obviously And it was really difficult ‘cause not only was I trying to learn English, but it’s a big school, and you know, the standard was so high and um, and the commute oh my gosh"
disappointment,"So, I got a scholarship I went to Dhaka for studying B A Honours But I gave up, no I didn't do Honours"
disappointment,"That certainly I did feel see because everybody said at Presidency --not my parents, not my home upbringing -- but everybody said that, you know, Gayatri does so well in her exams because she is such a good-looking young thing She's flashy, but the real brains are, like, Surajit Sen, and so on and so forth, but at any rate, so I thought I wouldn't get in And so Harvard and Yale, too good, so I chose Cornell for that reason And then I sent them, I remember, from Ballygunge Post Office, a telegram saying I was a very good student, which indeed I was I had come first class first in my BA in English honors, but I didn't need financial assistance, because I thought I wouldn't get a scholarship"
disappointment,"No I did very well in the exam; in fact I did very well all through school In fact the problem with my father is that my father, unlike American father’s, American parents who think and believe in positive feedback, my father did not believe in positive feedback, he did not praise you for doing well So after a point in the Hindu school he would look at the scores, not A,B,C, but actual, so many scores out of all the papers up to thousand, if you would do 800 something or 900 something So he would always compare that with the person stood second"
disappointment,"He didn’t, but I think he disliked the aggression of it He disliked how politicized education was becoming and there I would like to end by saying that indeed I do have feel that disappointment greatly,"
disappointment,"Excellent school Excellent school it was when I continuously referring to the past as we higher educational achievement of Bengal I think I should explain to you why I consider it has gone down You see somehow the institution of democracy that was adopted by the constitution writers of India was I think a premature action Because you cannot take decisions of equal importance by literate and illiterate person The illiterate person will be taking correct decision about his way of life, the way he can make money, can develop his skill but intellectuals are quite different"
disappointment,"I applied for scholarship from the Government of West Bengal and I got one it's called state scholarship, very poor, but because we became poor because prices were rising at that time before that when this amount was settled decided quite 400 pounds a year and that was a great amount of money say in 1945, 1947 not in 1954 and I applied for a Rhodes Scholarship So I have select about four people and they interact and I asked permission the government could I No we can't do it Afterwards"
disappointment,Taking the intermediate it was 4 'Ah' now it is 3 years but 2+2 The actual honors course we studied for two years and then for 2 years were graduate studies Post graduate we found a bit disappointing because while there were very great scholars  there were not good teachers In fact most of them were not terribly concerned with teaching
confusion,"” Ok, then I took, went for graduate school and uh it was little struggle, like a struggle in the sense I don't know what I'm doing and I don't know whether to apply for it and at that time, luckily, one of the best college in India, southern part, it is called Christian Medical College, Vellore M: Still it have a very high reputation for turning out uh medical graduates If you are a product, alumnae of CMC, they really look up on it"
confusion,"yea…there’s lots of stuff which confused me… like y’know in Sri Lanka there’s free college…so why is college soooo expensive here I guess at least it has to be a bit cheaper so people can actually afford it…um…and also um…just like specific stuff actually…stuff like paying – like paid leaves for mothers like that’s in Sri Lanka—Free Medical care that’s in Sri Lanka…uhm just like specific stuff I guess it’s a progressive country i don’t get—like such a progressive, like number one progressive country in the world…I don’t understand why Americans can get those stuff"
confusion,"I don’t know if you have seen it behind Park Street which used to be Sir Elijah Impey's garden house Beautiful, beautiful surroundings, that’s where I went to school from 1950 to 1958"
confusion,"Okay Um, so that kind of was a thing that I remembered And, um, that same year there was also like a vandalizing, um, of the student of the Jewish student org, or like one of the, the lawns were either destroyed or vandalized, um, and it was antisemitic So things like that started to come up more frequently in 2017 and I don't really know what, what was causing it, but obviously, you know, along with, um, Trump's election and everything, I dunno if there's direct correlation, but I'm going to say there is, um, but you know, more of those voices who, um, who are pro-Trump in the sense that they're racist or they're hateful towards other groups Um, those kinds of feelings started to come up around campus as well"

confusion,"No, not really I was never quite sure whether I wanted to be a doctor or an engineer, so I applied for both colleges I was pretty sure I was going to get a seat in both because the seats were assigned by the community and by your high school rank I was on the top of the class for the Christians, so I was sure I will have a seat on both of them But somebody sabotaged the medical application"
confusion,"Well, I don’t know if it was difficult to get used to; it was difficult in the sense of finding food that we liked It was much better to eat in the cafeteria where you could see the dishes, because the name didn’t tell you much as to what it would look like or  it would taste If you could see it in the cafeteria, you sort of had a good idea of which one you might like, and pick that food So mostly, all the time that we were in the dormitory or student housing, we ate cafeteria food Once in a while we went to the Chinese restaurant or pizza place, but those days, in the 50s, I think in Ohio there was only one pizza restaurant"
confusion,"First, let me talk about quantity versus quality It is possible to teach a larger number of students, with the same quality, with the same output, if you have a planned and scalable model If your scalable model has a syllabus, has a teaching methodology that is precise and predictable, if you have a process and teaching assistants who can replicate the intent that the artistic director has Then the ability of the artistic director to nurture a child can be replicated systematically through the predefined process, in a scalable fashion, while somebody is overseeing all these However, I am not sure if most of the large schools that you are talking about have actually mastered the ability to do that"
confusion,"But I’m not sure if it was a girl whether I would have felt differently I think as a girl’s mother, I would have felt a little more responsible But you have to have certain trust and also you have to kind of have the home atmosphere and education to know what is right and what is wrong"

anger,"To get to Class One Gazetted Officer can be 15 to 20 years, and here we walked in right away But the frustration of the other things were such that when I came , I came with a full mind that I’m going to stay now In my mind, I went, I tried my best, and worked, and enjoyed it while doing it there, but couldn’t see any long-term future in my field there As a matter of fact, one of my students… Oh, by the way, in any of my classes, nobody ever wanted to skip that They thought it was interesting classes"

surprise,"And, then the following year there was a … during summer vacation I was reading the newspaper with my morning chai, and I saw applications that invited student dancers And, the name of the institute was the same institute that this person on TV was And, I remember the dancer’s name, his name is, he is still alive, his name is Bhushan Lakhandri He is an excellent dancer, and I said, oh my God, this is the same institute that Rama learns dance … JP:  I got to join, and it is so serendipitous, right It’s all destiny"
surprise,"That was another thing which I found It was surprising for me to see that the price of, if I remember right, walking into this food store--Safeway, in the university area The price of apples and the price of onions were similar, or even onions were more expensive Which was, I was kind It was interesting and strange for me because when I was in India, onions were very reasonable, very cheap in those days, in Punjab area at least"

caring,"So I would tell people that if you feel like you need to be recognized and you need that financial assistance to make things happen, um, don't be afraid to start for student organization You only need I think like seven or nine folks to actually make an organization, uh, at Tech So in order to be able to get funding and you had approvals and stuff like that So if that's the only thing that's stopping you guys from um From making it official, then do, do the due diligence and make that, create a name and submit it into the student register, apply to make it official so they get recognized"
caring,"So, my group of six people, could be Japanese, Korean, or it could be Spanish So, what we would do is through our semester, we, each one would take one culture, and that person would lead, and we would experience their culture And we exchanged in that manner And I used many different resources or tools for mentoring, where they learn English, as well as, they might have difficulty in school with their children, or disciplining, or some other problem their face, paying electric bill, whatever And I would try to help them out in any which way I could, and show them the way"

curiosity,"Well that is interesting Now in terms of the very important books that you remember you mention kafka which makes me wonder about the world beyond Britain and were you conscious at that time of when you said reading western books when you said you were consious of the distinction is for example between America and British and German and French or for the student of Presidency College was this all in some ways and the western, western culture, the western tradition"
curiosity,"And then also, within that community, we also had friends who were in churches and were interested in seeing if we were interested in Page 6 connecting with them in that capacity and I was always curious about new religions So, I think that's one community that I got pretty close with I went to a couple Bible studies with my friends And that was also a really interesting way Hello"
curiosity,"I see… and how did you find that experience of shifting from student to faculty Hm…was there anything surprising to you about your first couple of years in America, were you surprised by anything in the culture, or the people What did you think of Americans more broadly when you first arrived And who did you primarily socialize with – was it mostly Indians or…"
curiosity,We were only a few of them in the classroom Some of them even didn't mind smoking in the class in those days Those things made me very curious to find out what was the reason They were very different relationship
curiosity,"That again has to do with history, which you are trying to record here PS: All this makes me very curious about the educational framework you grew up in Can you describe a little bit India Association of Minnesota Oral History Project  8about your family’s values about education when you were growing up and how you viewed education and how it began to shape your life"
approval,Yes very well They were very famous school of teachers in Economics in those days Mostly they were influenced by Keynesian thinking
approval,"Yes, yes, I matriculated from Priya Nath High School which is now known as Nawabpur Government High School We were the last batch of that private school before it was taken over by the government Then I studied at the Jagannath College then at the university"
approval,He agreed because at that time he was at the helm of what is called the Maulana Azad Kalam Institute of Asian Studies and he was encountering difficulties in setting up Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Central Asian Studies That ways you know it has caught me and the first batch of teachers who willingly co operated with me to take the trouble of moving from this building to another building and I had also taken the part of looking after all the 8 papers I had to learn all the 8 papers to reason to very quickly to advise students to go about
approval,"Yes, absolutely, I did speak to the oh on the lives of the cosmopolitan well the 60's the '68 revolution, an amazing time for the students, an era Oh, fully, we were involved but only as I mean we didn't we didn't go out and demonstrate but yeah, I must confess but yes very much so"
approval,"Sure Yeah So initially, honestly, when I first joined, the reason that I wanted to get a degree in the United States was because in Nepal, after the last two years of high school is what we call college And that's when you choose, if either you do science, humanities or management, and then after that you would choose a really accelerated and specific program, and I didn't feel ready I was doing biology already, because at that point, that's what made more sense to me"
approval,"Exactly Exactly So, there are umpteen imageries in all our myth--It’s full of values So what I do is I bring to the audience, my aim in teaching the students is the value of those values Your values are there, you don’t tell the truth"
approval,"You’re right, and I had a problem that time trying to accept the fact that I would be doing a little bit of biology, I would have to read those books But I was told that if I wanted to do science, that would be the most appropriate thing to study because there is a lot of science to be done in that area That was explained by my college professors"
approval,You’re right That sort of was the intention of coming to Einstein Plus the fact was that department at that time was the best department in that school
approval,"Oh yeah, I was very much interested in it In fact, in 1946 when I was living in another town called Nagpur – my father had moved from Allahabad to Nagpur and became Dairy Development Officer for a state called C P and Berar I was going to a school called Dharampeth High School, and in 46, some people asked me if I would stand in front of the school and tell kids not togo to school today because the French are killing Vietnamese"
approval,"Yeah it is challenging It was challenging but I liked it And because my father could speak in English, he had some English knowledge, he gave us some initial, you know, training in English So I was generally comfortable But there were students who could not read in English"
annoyance,"And quite a number of political decisions of the government has to take verge on those values Do you need this kind of aam aadmi deshi It is a debate even the common man living in the cities will not be able to participate and realize what is the problem with the city But you have to take a decision on that and what happened the democracy made the government made another great mistake, great mistake committed by Jawaharlal Nehru himself which is that they put emphasis on higher education and establish large number of institutions of repute, research and teaching but neglected primary education, school education So this neglect created a kind of a filter to take out those people from the society for training who had money to buy the education"
annoyance,"So I lived in the house for 4 years, rhappily, so but yeah that's my… Then River Forest I hads no issues, there was nothing there No then there was a little issue at the hospital I cannot tell if this is discrimination, but all the department heads or position they were non-Americans were getting replaced after new administrator came And he told me that he has surveyed all the hospitals that's part of the university’s in assisting with the same job title is mine, I'm overpaid I said yes you are right at work but I didn't ask for raises"
annoyance,"And that, here, has not changed Now, in India that's not true, I mean, women are treated badly no matter where you go, but  once you do the work, you get paid equal Here, some of our professors will say, Oh well, he's recently married, he has a young bride, so a male doctor who would get higher salary The woman doctor wouldn’t So, it was insane"
annoyance,"I used to complain that they were too loud You couldn’t study And they were all freshmen So they were all freshmen and me there, as a graduate student, it just didn’t work out"
annoyance,"Yes I mean, it was a repetitious job I cannot say that I enjoyed it But it was a job, so I was doing it just to get through the school"
annoyance,"Oh, if you truly, as a parent or a child, why are you doing this, I don’t think they know the answer They are like, “oh isn’t that what you do at the end of your dance training Isn’t it what we should anyway do by the ninth grade, because eleventh grade and twelfth grade is complex … you know, way too much schoolwork and I can put it in my college application ” And, the colleges have become smart to this whole thing Nowadays I have that one of my students told me, they don’t give much value to the arangetrams, because there is nobody that legitimizes any arangetram, or that there is no quality bar"
annoyance,"And somehow, I was just not able to…the ECFMG was just not getting through because so many things bothered me and I think that I was not able to concentrate or something I didn’t make the ECFMG in two attempts and it was frustrating me more And it was happening to a lot of people In the meantime, I’d met some other FMGs , you know, international students in Seattle who were in the same boat like me And then, I came to know that in New Jersey, there was this one program offered for international graduates"
annoyance,"And the Indian friends, they talk about stock markets, you know how much the stock market And if these people are talking to my buddies and colleagues from the university, you talk about stock market and they'll say, God, this is horrible I mean, this is so uncivilized, to get together and rather than talking about the environmental problem, all you're talking about is how's the stock market So, you live in two different worlds and you have been very careful that when these people are talking the stock market that you don't send them the message that you will be bored by it That you think what they're talking about is stupid"
annoyance,"How will you handle that And we in Pakistan-, how could I think of sending my child to school, when my monthly earning is three thousand rupees Totally deteriorated--"
annoyance,"I just was not interested in what was going on in my classes My interest was in French existentialism, Jean Paul Sartre, and the political dimension of everything I mean something like the French intelligentsia, there was something like a coffeehouse culture there also, we even got together and talked about politics And I was very active in the theater and I did some plays with the University group And I just gave up on academia, and I didn’t have money to pay for it anyway"
disapproval,"No, no I never Professor Habibullah was apolitical, I mean though he was very progressive -- No, no"
disapproval,"No, I have no school in mind here and I am not interested in influencing other people I'm interested in teaching, the way I am thinking about the subject, the way it excites me, and I have invested a great deal of energy in teaching I mean, when you say well, I've got some twenty graduate students from here doing their thesis"
disapproval,"Yeah, yeah I would still not say that, because Presidency College as an institution doesn't have quality, stamp of quality The students, a very large section of the brighter students still go there, but inevitably afterwards they migrate to Delhi, to JNU, Delhi University also"
disapproval,"No I am not interested ” So I decided to go to private practice, in Albany And I almost signed the paper, but my boss, the academic boss in Winnipeg, said, “You can’t do that You have done so much, you should go on academic career And we'll find a place"
disapproval,"No, no, I wanted to go back and contribute to my university They wanted me to specialize and contribute to the program"
disapproval,I did not believe in that I said that I am not going to go through I want a PhD So I went to Delhi University I interviewed there
disapproval,"No, not really, because first of all, I was the major earner anyway Even though she was working in the store, I still was the backbone of it, I still worked there, I still did the financial contribution and gave the direction and so forth It wasn’t because she was working she enjoyed one special status, but we are both educated, we are both college graduates and it wasn’t like in India, if the girl is not educated, there might be a different kind of relationship I still think our relationship was good and respectful, and I would still admit from seeing from my point of view, and I don’t think she would disagree It might be 51, 49, or 60, 40, but still the man was the boss in the house"
disapproval,"No, it is not typical It just takes five years, but that area was so bad, we had a lot of turmoil and student rebellion and this and that, so they closed the university for three months and that did gradually prolong it So five years became six years Yes, dormitories"
disapproval,""" But I was not selfconfident, and so I said, ""No, it's not possible for me to study further "" Then he did not say anything By this time, the sponsorship came out, and I came here, because then I don't have to study I just had to — I'm not very technically minded I may be good in technical, you know, regarding the grades and all, but I don't have an aptitude for that"
disapproval,"That is not acceptable or not done There are two reasons for that The opportunities are not there, because so many adults are looking for jobs Plus the students are so hard-pressed for their studies and commuting back and forth to school A lot of kids have to spend one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening just reaching their college or university, so they don’t have much time for doing side jobs like the high school kids do it here"
optimism,"I think like, because I interviewed all the women participants, I guess like a primary audience because this is an academic book, right So primary audiences are always gonna be scholars and students, but my hope is that I write the book in a way that the language is accessible to the communities of women, or like disaster responders, or crisis communicators, or volunteers, you know all those people who wanna work in disaster And if they see and read this book or find it online somehow, they can read the stories of women And that's what I think like the book is specifically for those people, like whoever is interested in disaster and disaster response"
optimism,"So I was hoping to go into academic medicine when I came to America That’s where I got a lot of trouble I did not get a job It was a new specialty, and I was one of the few people at that time had this training But I was not American medical graduate, American graduate"
optimism,"Actually I didn't, except my professors who had been to California, they told me it was a good place At that time, there was no TV, so I never watched anything Now, everybody in India knows everything about here, but at that time I didn't know, except what I had heard I knew there will be good education, that's all I knew"
optimism,"So, I think these students helped me survive my personal tragedies You know, when I lost my son I thought to myself, other people have sons and I can help them, you know And why don't I just do that, instead of grieving over my own sorrow So, I think that they helped me a lot And hopefully, since they’re all doctors, they will help me in my health situation, if it gets bad"
optimism,"You can have all the good ideas, but if your colleague doesn’t have good hands or doesn’t generate good reagents, ideas go down the drain, and I cannot do anything about it So this is a difficult place in terms of competing That’s why I realized that just to be able to keep myself above the water, what I have to do is do something else which the big labs are not doing, something which is still very important I am doing it, and I am hoping that at some point I will be able to get out of this type of situation where I’m considered as a teacher I teach a lot"
optimism,"Their hope is if they could recruit good faculty members--aggressive researchers--then this place might become-- But we--who were being recruited by the people--we had the trouble of recruiting associates who are good I cannot imagine a good American student will come to this university There’s no reason for a good American student to come to this university because there’s U of C , there’s Northwestern They are better-known places for their research Although in terms of doing science, my lab does as good science as someone in U of C or Northwestern"
optimism,"India had become independent , so we still had a lot of schools that were run by British missionaries, and they were  schools, where the medium of instruction was English, and the instruction was very good by Indian standards My experiences there have stood me  my life They patterned my personality, my likes, my dislikes They encouraged two things: “Play the game” and “Others,” which meant you have to  think about others, before you think about just yourself The thing I remember most was what I was always told by my father, “You’ve got to go out and get the best education in the world, because that will open doors for you"
optimism,"They can enact stringent legislations but they cannot erase the knowledge from people’s heads So hopefully, whatever the Republicans have done in the last thirty years will backfire and we can get back on track to being a more humane society, and that progressive ideals were not fought in vain after all Those were heady times to be young in Unfortunately, I don’t see that kind of youth and student activism in this day and age But I bet you, that if ever the military draft got re-instated, student activism would follow immediately"
optimism,"What that meant was that we could graduate in less than four years, so that was a very big incentive And even though it was very expensive to come here, I was able to convince my parents to sponsor me in the first year or two Then I promised I’d try to make money here to get through college So that’s how we ended up here"
optimism,"I am talking about academic opportunities for young people, individuals, children, how competitive it is So the more progress there is, the more competitive it will be So it has become a highly competitive society in terms of academics and therefore jobs Yet, there is opportunity So there is more hope"
embarrassment,"This is what it is ” Till she corrected me, which was  half the weeks of the quarter, I thought it was Dr Schubert It was embarrassing She related it to both the professors"
embarrassment,"I felt even more embarrassed at that point So I could only say I am sorry So they took me to their house, and they said we are assigned to take care of you And I thought oh that’s nice It was a family with two girls and they had other foreign students they were housing in their house"
embarrassment,"Or did you learn when you moved Nowadays if you go to India, uh, English is almost like a first  language, uh, especially in big cities; but when I was growing up, um, because of our British influence in India, they ruled India for so long, we—I did learn English in school So I had a very good knowledge of a theoretical English But I was not good in speaking, fluent in speaking when I came here And my accent was very different, it was more of  a, um, British-come-Indian accent"
embarrassment,"I had some trouble getting in --It’s an interesting story how I got in I got in Because one of the Selection Committee members was my professor and when the other examiner–questioner --some lady --asked me if I won any prizes in college, I sheepishly said “No, no, I didn’t have any <i>inaudible</i>” Then this man came to my rescue and said “What do mean no prizes Didn’t you get this prize for tennis, and cricket, and this and that ” “Yes sir, yes sir ” He had come for the --he was guest of honor for the Hostel Day celebrations Where they give prizes to people who had won something"
embarrassment,"Everyone was so proud of it and we were embarrassed “You realize, this is embarrassing ” Everything is so exaggerated when you’re that age too So like in the midst of that community we really formed a strong bond within our own feminist community The Women’s Studies program at SUNY Albany also has this thing called a feminist collective where they trained students to teach Feminism 101"
embarrassment,"Because if it was successful, I would not be sitting here working and paying rent  and — that's not true But yes, I did that And through that kind of learned a lot more about global health and about public health, particularly It's a huge shame I didn't know about public health, considering I went to the school that was number one for public health But you know, it's an outreach problem, really for the school, I guess"
embarrassment,"Of course, it was there I don't know how they realized it Or maybe it's just an American thing That was nice to kind of, like I said before, have the best of both worlds Seventh grade was pretty awkward, but in se venth grade I started to kind of win some awards and start to kind of get some recognition on speeches, making speeches, and I did some other stuff that you didn't have the opportunities in elementary school"
embarrassment,"I remember at that time, too, you know, I didn't want her to come in I don't think I told her I didn't want her to come in, but I was embarrassed I just thought, ""Oh, the kids are going to make fun of me "" But then she did, and everybody was so interested, and she looked so pretty, and everyone told me how pretty my mom was I think because the slides showed scenes of India that were not what was being taught in the school, that kind of helped also"
embarrassment,"Well, let's see Junior high was kind of a big change I think up 'til then, in grade school, I was very, very shy I'd make friends, and once I had made friends with somebody, I was pretty talkative In fact, I think I got sent to sit on the bench outside the principal's office more than once for talking during class when I wasn't supposed to be"
embarrassment,"So I would do things like tell them, ""Don't call me Alli, don't speak Malayalam,"" and then I grew out of that stage, and went into the, ""I want to learn more about India "" When people would ask me questions, especially in geography, ""Where is India in relation to--"" I didn't always have the answers, and people would be surprised by that ""What do you mean, you don't know "" So I'd get really embarrassed about that, because I thought, ""Well, gosh, I should know "" But then, I would think later, ""Well, I have the same education as they do, and nobody teaches me about India,"" unless my parents taught me something"
nervousness,"Looking back, I think I just felt really confused and very pressured, because I had been told all this time that this is what I want to do, and I think I had somewhat believed it India Association of Minnesota Oral History Project  20myself, but I enjoyed the history classes and English classes and other things so much more, and I enjoyed talking about issues and people and that kind of thing so much more than I enjoyed dissection, and I was really worried that I was missing out on something So, I think probably sometime in my junior year I started making rumblings about maybe I need to take some time off after college, and that was not going over very well at all So, ultimately, I think what I had agreed to do was to take the MCATs and then see how my scores were, and then decide what to do So, the summer between my junior and senior year, I was living at home and my parents paid for me to take this prep course, the Kaplan course, to prepare me for taking the MCATs, and neither my heart nor my mind was really in it I would go to these classes and daydream the whole time and doodle and leave early"
